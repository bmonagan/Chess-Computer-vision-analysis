queens_gambit being a png might be changing how it is interpreted by the program. In my mind it is weird that it would be because i think of png as a higher level format.
The entire training set was jpegs so maybe that is playing a role in it. Not sure at this point. Going to try to convert it to jpeg and run them with each other.


Trying with the close up image worked a little bit better. Still getting white labels for many black pieces but it is generally identifying the correct piece even if the color is wrong.
